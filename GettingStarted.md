# Getting Started into RPM Fusion administration

## There are two areas related to RPM Fusion administration:
* sysadmin: the group responsible of handling various infra services.
* releng:  the group responsible for package content including signing and pushing content.


## The skills you may want to learn to do this work include:
* Mastering Ansible.Take a look at  [Ansible RPM Fusion](https://github.com/rpmfusion-infra/ansible-rpmfusion/)
* Knowing how to write scripts for system administration
* Knowing how to write web applications using Python and SQL or equivalent technologies
* Knowing how to debug and specially how to audit systems, services and applications.
* Knowing how the RPM Fusion project works behind the scenes

## Other pluses
* Have previous systems admin experience
* Have access to your own testing machines for testing and staging prod ('''Huge plus!'''  Our resources are limited obviously, especially for testing which we haven't)
* Work in other areas of RPM Fusion like Packaging or Documentation
