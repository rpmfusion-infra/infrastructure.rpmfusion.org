## About us

The Infrastructure Team consists of dedicated volunteers and professionals who provide servers, tools and utilities for the RPM Fusion Repositories. We are the people that maintain the servers that run the RPM Fusion Infrastructure.  We're located all over the globe so we communicate primarily by:

 * __IRC__
  You can find the __#rpmfusion-admin__ channel on [liberachat](https://libera.chat/).

 * __Mailing list__
  The mailing list for the RPM Fusion Infrastructure notifications is [sysadmin-notify mailing list](https://lists.rpmfusion.org/archives/list/sysadmin-notify@lists.rpmfusion.org/).

## Contribute to RPM Fusion Infrastructure
Ready to work with the RPM Fusion Infrastructure team? We're looking for smart, volunteers, dedicated system administrators and developers to help maintain our systems and also write some code.
